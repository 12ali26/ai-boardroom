🔧 NAVIGATION ISSUE FIXED! 🔧

✅ PROBLEM RESOLVED:
════════════════════

🚫 **Issue**: Unicode emoji characters in filenames caused navigation errors
   - Pages like "01_💬_AI_Chat.py" couldn't be found by Streamlit
   - st.switch_page() calls were failing silently
   - Users got "page not found" errors

✅ **Solution Applied**:
   - Renamed all page files to ASCII-only filenames
   - Updated all navigation links throughout the application
   - Preserved emoji icons in page titles and UI elements
